Recently, I've been using neovim as a full-time replacement for vim in my daily workflow. It was ridiculously easy to get started, and so far I am really enjoying the benefits it has. The main benefit is that its plugins can run asynchronously, which is awesome. This means that when [Neomake](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake) (the neovim version of [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)) runs JSHint or JSCS against my file, it doesn't completely freeze nvim while doing so. This is awesome!

To get started with Neovim, you can simply install it from homebrew on OSX:

```bash
brew tap neovim/neovim
brew install --HEAD neovim
```

You can also install it on other operating systems, such as Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install neovim
```

When getting started, you can simply symlink your `~/.vimrc` to `~/.nvimrc` and your `~./vim` to `~/.nvim` and things should just work. However, I ended up going the route of having configurations for vim and nvim so that I could easily go back to vim if I encountered any issues while using it in my day job.

I recently gave a lightning talk on Neovim at the Omaha Ruby and Open Source Meetup. Check out the slides and video from the talk below if you'd like to learn more. Also, please ask me questions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicknisi)!
