I love vim. I've been using it full-time for over three years and I still feel like a beginner at it. But I also feel productive in it. I had an opportunity to talk about vim and how I use it in tmux at February's OMG!Code. In this talk, I introduce some vim basics, talk about the best parts of vim, some of my favorite plugins, and then I integrate tmux into the talk and how I typically work with these two technologies throughout the day. It wraps up with a nice discussion of different plugins and configurations.

## Repo

This [repo](https://github.com/nicknisi/vim-workshop) contains the slides and a default vim and tmux configuration, which I slimmed down from my full config to the settings and plugins which I think are essential for being productive quickly with vim and tmux.
