# Projects

For a complete list of up-to-date projects, check me out on [Github](https://github.com/nicknisi).

## [Thumbs](https://github.com/c2fo/thumbs)

Thumbs is an “evolution” on top of Backbone, bringing some of the best parts of Dojo over to the Backbone/jQuery world.

## [Dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles)

I am a big command line and vim user. These files set up my universe.

## [grunt-bower-config](https://github.com/nicknisi/grunt-bower-config)

This task adds an extra step in the bower installation process, allowing us to download all dependency files (which often include the dependency’s entire git repo) into a temporary
location and then copy only the files we need (specified in the component.json/bower.json) into our project’s vendor directory.

## [Wedding Game]()

An incomplete game featuring myself, my wife, and Neil Diamond. It originally appeared on our wedding web site, but, like many things, I never got around to fully finishing it. Enjoy!
