<h1 class="text-6xl">My Vim Timeline</h1>

Since my very first Computer Science class in college, I've been using Vim as my primary editor, with only a few forays into other options. Admittedly, my initial experiences with Vim were less than stellar - I didn't have a good grasp of how to make the most of its features.

Years later, after experimenting with Eclipse, NetBeans, Notepad++, TextMate, and Sublime Text, I rediscovered the joy of using Vim. I was particularly drawn to the growing trend of storing Vim configurations in Github [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) repositories, and decided to give it a shot. From the outset, I made a point of keeping my configuration open and have worked tirelessly to improve it over the course of more than a decade.

On this page, I've put together a brief timeline highlighting some of the most significant milestones in my ongoing journey with Vim.
