<h1 class="text-6xl">My Vim Timeline</h1>

Since my very first Computer Science class in college, I've been using Vim as my primary editor, with only a few forays into other options. Admittedly, my initial experiences with Vim were less than stellar - I didn't have a good grasp of how to make the most of its features.

Years later, after experimenting with Eclipse, NetBeans, Notepad++, TextMate, and Sublime Text, I rediscovered the joy of using Vim. I was particularly drawn to the growing trend of storing Vim configurations in Github [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) repositories, and decided to give it a shot. From the outset, I made a point of keeping my configuration open and have worked tirelessly to improve it over the course of more than a decade.

On this page, I've put together a brief timeline highlighting some of the most significant milestones in my ongoing journey with Vim.

My experience with Vim has been a journey of discovery and continuous improvement. Despite some initial challenges, I eventually found my way back to Vim and have been using it ever since! My journey with Vim is far from over. As with any tool or skill, there is always more to learn and new ways to improve. Despite having used Vim for over a decade, I am still discovering new features and techniques that I can incorporate into my workflow. I believe that this is one of the most rewarding aspects of using Vim - the learning never stops. By continuing to explore and experiment with Vim, I am confident that I will be able to further enhance my productivity and efficiency, and uncover new ways to make my development experience more enjoyable and satisfying.
