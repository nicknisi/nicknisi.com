## Talk abstract

Your application state is too complex. There are too many states to manage, it's difficult to test in isolation, and fidelity is lost when translating from high-level abstracts into runnable code. But, what if there was a better way? What if you could model your application into a finite number of states and test it in isolation, as if it were just another component in your application? In this talk, we'll explore modeling application state with XState while utilizing Storybook and React to treat it as if it were just another component that can be visually reviewed and understood by both the development and product teams, and can be tested independently of any UI code. From this talk, you'll hear about how we did just that to manage some of the most complex pieces of our application.
