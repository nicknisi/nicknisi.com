I'm a Software Engineer, coding professionally since 2009 and focused primarily on the front end and
JavaScript/TypeScript. I am a big fan of community involvement, and have been involved in local meetups since the start.
I have also been involved in the behind the scenes organization of several conferences, and helmed a couple, including
TypeScript Conf US and the Nebraska JavaScript conference.

Outside of tech, I am a dad to two amazing kids. I'm also an avid karaoke enthusiast. My go-to songs include _Kiss_ by
Prince and _How am I Supposed to Live Without You_ by Michael Bolton. I am also an ordained Jedi Knight who has
presided over nine weddings.
