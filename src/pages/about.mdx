Hi! I'm Nick Nisi — dad of two, husband, and Developer Experience Engineer at [WorkOS](https://workos.com).

You might know me from co-hosting the [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) podcast, or from organizing [NEJS Conf](https://nejsconf.com) and [TypeScript Conf](https://archive.tsconf.io/2021/). These days I run the [NebraskaJS](https://nebraskajs.com) meetup and focus on developer tooling and TypeScript.

Outside of tech, I've officiated {metadata.officiantCount} weddings — turns out "conference emcee" translates surprisingly well to "wedding officiant."

## Bio

Here's a few different versions of my bio that you can use for different purposes.

### First Person Bio

<CopyableContent padding border>
Hey, I’m Nick! I’m a Developer Experience Engineer at [WorkOS](https://workos.com), where I focus on creating tools and experiences that make life easier for developers building for the modern web. I’m a long-time TypeScript enthusiast and community builder — I’ve organized conferences like [NEJS Conf](https://nejsconf.com) and [TypeScript Conf](https://archive.tsconf.io), emcee’d more than ten events, and taught JavaScript and TypeScript workshops for years.

Previously, I co-hosted the [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) podcast, chatting about all things JavaScript and web development. These days, I’m focused on developer productivity, open source, and helping teams build with confidence — and maybe still sneaking in a few conference talks along the way.
