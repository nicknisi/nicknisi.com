# /Now

What I'm up to, as of 2024-12-09.

## Work

I'm currently a Software Engineer on the Optimal Account Setup team within the Advertiser Experiences Platform at
[Meta](https://meta.com).

## Creating

I am a cohost on the [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) podcast. This is coming to an end in 2024, but I will be contuing
the party on [The Dysfunctional Developer](https://dysfucntional.fm). See the [blog
post](/posts/seven-years-of-jsparty).

I am the organizer of [NebraskaJS](https://nebraskajs.com). This is a local JavaScript meetup group in Omaha, NE and was
at one point a [regional conference](https://nejsconf.com).

I'm also working on a startup called [Orchestrate](https://useorchestrate.com), and I do some
consulting consulting at [Side Effects, LLC](https://sideeffects.dev).
