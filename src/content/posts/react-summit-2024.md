[KBall](https://zendev.com) and I are going to be in NYC (actually, the conference is in Jersey City) representing [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) at [React Summit](https://reactsummit.us) on November 19th, 2024! React Summit is one of the largest React-focused developer conferences, bringing together thousands of developers to explore the latest in React development. We'll be talking to folks, doing interviews, and having fun. If you're around, stop by and say hi!
