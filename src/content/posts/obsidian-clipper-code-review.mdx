My friend, [John Christopher](https://jdotc.xyz/) has been working on a new [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin
called [Obsidian Clipper](https://github.com/jgchristopher/obsidian-clipper). It's a plugin that allows users to clip
parts of a website into their daily note. It's a pretty cool plugin, and you should check it out.

He asked me to take a look at the code for a big refactor he was doing. It's a TypeScript project, and uses Svelte for
its plugin UI. We decided to do the review together and record it! It's a good example of typical code reviews I do and
was something that we both learned a lot from.
