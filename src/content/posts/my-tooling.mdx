In 2023, KBall interviewed me on [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) about my developer tooling setup, and generally how I use my tools. I thought
it would be beneficial to link up a more info that delves into my tools, how I use them, and how you can set up your tools as well.

You can listen to the show here.

<Audio episode={278} />

This is a great overview of what typically goes into my daily workflow and the tools I use to get my job done. I
absoluately believe that one should always use the right tool for the job, and that translates into my tools constantly
changing as I learn, grow, and evolve! For example, the first tool I talk about in the episode is about the wonderful
[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#) terminal emulator but in the months since this show has gone out, I have switched off that and over to
[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html). As my tooling changes I tend to keep my [/uses](/uses) page
up-to-date, so check there for the latest and greatest!

Of course, the major star of my tooling workflow is my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles)! With this
setup, I can go from new machine to ready to work in less than 20 minutes by relying on tools like
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Neovim](https://neovim.io). I catalog my journey from Vim
novice to ~expert~ where I'm at now [here](/vim)

## A Video Walkthrough

I spoke to [Josh Medeski](https://www.joshmedeski.com) about my tooling setup and how it's changed over the years. It's a fun show and definitely
worth a watch.

It categorizes the changes that have happened since my somewhat popular video on the same subject from years earlier.
You can watch that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r6yzFEXajQ).
