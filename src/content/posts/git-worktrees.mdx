Git [worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) are extremely powerful. In short, they allow you to checkout a
branch into a specific directory. Then, you can checkout another branch into another directory. From here, switching
branches is as simple as switching directories! This is essential for developers who might be working on several things
at once or who are regularly interrupted and need to switch to a bug fix or even just need to review some code.

The most basic use of a git worktree is to simply checkout a branch using the following command.

```bash
git worktree add -b feature-branch origin/main ../feature-branch
```

This will create a new directory as a sibling to your normal working directory, create a branch called
`feature-branch`, and set the inital state of the branch to be that of `origin/main`. Inside this new directory will be
the exact project checked out where you can run all of the normal git commands and set up the project as normal.

	You'll need to `npm install` or do whatever to set up your project as you normally would, as if this were a new clone.
</Callout>

One thing I don't like about this setup is the "scatteredness" of my repo with one seemingly _blessed_ worktree and
then a bunch of siblings that are outside of that worktree. Instead, I like to use a [bare
repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server#_bare_repo) setup. In this, the project
is checked out without a working tree, similar to how it would be on GitHub and elsewhere.

```bash
â–· git clone --bare git@github.com:nicknisi/dotfiles.git dotfiles

```

As you can see in here, we now have the files that would normally appear in the `.git/` directory directly inside the
directory we made when cloning the repository. So far that doesn't seem better! From here, we could create a new
worktree with the command above and it would appear inline with all of these important-looking git files, which adds a
lot of confusion. Instead, we can hide the `.git` files inside of another directory when we bare clone the repository.
I like to call this directory `.bare`.

```bash
â–· mkdir -p ~/Developer/dotfiles
â–· git clone --bare git@github.com:nicknisi/dotfiles.git .bare
```

```shell
# create a new directory for the repository
â–· mkdir project && cd project
# glone the repository (bare) and hide it in a hidden direcotry
â–· git clone --bare git@github.com:user/project.git .bare
# create a `.git` file that points to the bare repo
â–· echo "gitdir: ./.bare" > .git
```

The benefit of this setup is that the bare repo contents are hidden away in `.bare`, and then the directory containing
that effectively becomes a place to create worktrees associated with that bare repo, thanks to the `.git` file, which
is a pointer to where the git database is located.

From here, new worktrees can be created and maintained like normal. However, there are a few small issues because when
a bare repo is cloned remote-tracking branches are not created. So, when trying to `git fetch`, no remote branches are
fetched. This can be fixed with a few commands to update what happens on fetch and to associate local branches with the
their remote.

```shell
â–· git config remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
â–· git fetch
â–· git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads | xargs -n1 -I{} git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/{}
```

	I created a [script](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/git-bare-clone) to help make this setup
	easier.
</Callout>

## The downsides

While I think this setup is fantastic and I don't see myself going back to the old, single woking directory lifestyle,
there are a few downsides that you should be aware of.

### Each worktree is effectively its own project

Each worktree exists independently of the other. This is obviously a good thing because it means you can run them
independently and simultanously, it also means that you need to `npm install` (or your equivelant) on every one of
them. This means that the creation and setup of each worktree can be an ordeal. For my main work project, `npm install`
takes about 5 minutes ðŸ˜±.

### The output of `git branch` is pretty useless

Looking to see what branches you have created locally becomes more of an ordeal because the `git branch` command will
list every branch that exists in the bare clone.

```shell
â–· git --no-pager branch | wc -l
    1520
```

## How I use worktrees to get things done

I will use my `git bare-clone` script to set up a new, bare repository ready-to-go for creating multiple worktrees. In
the way I work, I will create a new worktree for each feature that I am working on, meaning I will have several
worktrees that I regularly prune with `git worktree remove`. However, there are a few stable worktrees that I will
perpetually keep around in a project.

- `main` - The main worktree simply contains the `main` branch checked out. It's the easiest way to run the current
  _known good_ state. I can run this side-by-side with my feature branch worktree to compare and contrast functionality
  on the fly.
- `review` - This is a worktree that I'll use to check out a pull request I am reviewing so that I can test it, run
  it, run its tests, etc. I'll use the fantastic `gh pr checkout 1234` command from the [GitHub
  CLI](https://cli.github.com) to check out PRs easily into this
  worktree.
- `hotfix` - this worktree is reserved for quickly creating hotfix PRs in. I keep this around because I want to quickly
  jump in and start working rather than creating a new feature-branch worktree and then waiting for the long, long `npm
install` to finish.

### Quickly creating new worktrees

To save time, I made a [helper script](https://gist.github.com/nicknisi/a26f148611517e3d998eb456ac57efff) that I use to
create new worktrees for each feature branch. This is mostly straightforward, and the main benefit this gives me is to
automatically create and push a remote feature branch, kick off `npm install`, and kick off a build of my project. It
can take several minutes to complete, but it's set and forget and then I can come back to a fully up-and-running
worktree, ready to be worked!

## Conclusion

Using git worktrees are a big change to how I approach development on large projects where I'm involved in lots of
different ways including feature work, reviews, and hotfixes. There's good and bad to them, but for me, the good
outweighs the bad and I don't see myself ever going back!
