I'm thrilled to be co-emceeing [SquiggleConf](https://2024.squiggleconf.com) at the New England Aquarium in Boston on October 3-4, 2024. This conference focuses on supercharging web developers and their tools, bringing together experts to discuss cutting-edge web development practices. 1

**Key highlights:**

- Diverse speaker and topic lineup
- Two-day event featuring full-length talks (30 minutes + Q&A) on excellent web dev tooling.
- Organized by [Dimitri Mitropoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrimitropoulos/) and [Josh Goldberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuakgoldbergcodes/), who are passionate about advancing web development.

As my 10th emcee role and 3rd in an aquarium setting, I'm excited to contribute to this impactful event and its stellar lineup of speakers.

I also had the honor of sitting down with Dimitri and Josh on JS Party to discuss the conference and growing
communities. [Give it a listen](https://changelog.com/jsparty/339)!
