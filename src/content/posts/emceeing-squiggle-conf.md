**Key highlights:**

- Diverse speaker lineup including Aakansha Doshi (Excalidraw Core Maintainer), Chris Griffing (WASM Fanatic), and Corina Murg.
- Two-day event featuring full-length talks (30 minutes + Q&A) on excellent web dev tooling.

As my 10th emcee role and 3rd in an aquarium setting, I'm excited to contribute to this impactful event and its stellar lineup of speakers.
