JS Party is [coming to an end](https://changelog.com/posts/a-new-era-for-the-changelog-podcast-universe).

When I joined JS Party back at episode 20 nearly seven years ago, I had no idea how this journey would transform both my professional life and my connection to the JavaScript community. As we prepare our final episodes, I find myself reflecting on what this incredible chapter has meant to me.

## The State of Change

I'll be honest â€“ when I first heard about the end of JS Party, it hit me hard. Change, even positive change, can be difficult to process. But after seeing Adam and Jerod's vision for Changelog's future, I've found myself genuinely excited about what's ahead! 

## More Than Just a Tech Podcast

JS Party became more than just a weekly tech show â€“ it evolved into a genuine community gathering place. One of my favorite memories (which perfectly encapsulates the show's spirit) was [interviewing Adam Wathan](https://changelog.com/jsparty/155) about [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) while exclusively speaking in "Wind Beneath My Wings" lyrics. This blend of technical content and unabashed fun became our signature style, making complex topics accessible and entertaining, and even had Adam in on it by the end!

## Lessons Learned

Perhaps the most valuable lesson I'm taking away from this experience is that there truly are no stupid questions (except maybe "Why doesn't Nick use VS Code?" ðŸ˜‰). In our industry, everyone is constantly learning and growing, and I've witnessed firsthand how supportive and helpful the tech community can be. Whether it was a beginner asking their first question or an experienced developer exploring new territory, JS Party always strived to be a welcoming space for curiosity and growth.

## Community Impact

What makes my heart full is how the show connected people across the vast JavaScript ecosystem. We bridged gaps between different frameworks and languages, always remembering that JavaScript is the thread that binds the web together. Some of my most cherished moments have been the unexpected ones â€“ like being recognized by a listener on planes or connecting with someone who spotted my JS Party t-shirt while I was at my kid's gymnastics practice. These encounters remind me that our weekly conversations reached far beyond our microphones.

## Personal Growth

Looking back, I can't overstate how much I've grown through this experience. JS Party gave me a platform to advocate for tools I'm passionate about (Vim and TypeScript forever!), but more importantly, it helped me build meaningful connections throughout the tech community. Each episode was an opportunity to learn something new, challenge my assumptions, and grow alongside our listeners.

## The Road Ahead

While one chapter is ending, I'm genuinely excited about what's next. The Changelog Podcast Universe ([CPU.fm](https://cpu.fm)) represents a new frontier for tech podcasting, and [dysfunctional.fm](https://dysfunctional.fm) will carry forward the spirit of community and fun that made JS Party special. The party isn't over â€“ we're just changing the runtime!

To everyone who's ever tuned in, shared an episode, or reached out with feedback: thank you for being part of this journey. The JavaScript ecosystem is vast and ever-changing, but it's the people â€“ the developers, the creators, and the listeners â€“ who make it special. I look forward to continuing our conversations and building new connections through dysfunctional.fm.

The show may be ending, but the community we've built together lives on. Here's to the next chapter!
