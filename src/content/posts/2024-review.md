2024 was a year of significant transitions and growth, marked by new adventures at Meta, a return to in-person conferences, and ultimately, a exciting new role at WorkOS. Looking back, it's amazing how much can change in just twelve months.

## The Meta Chapter

My time at Meta was intense and educational. Working on one of the world's largest React applications taught me invaluable lessons about scale and complexity. While I ultimately decided to move on ([more on that here](/posts/on-leaving-meta)), the experience of collaborating across offices in Menlo Park, London, and New York shaped my perspective on building global products. I spent over a month in Menlo Park alone, immersing myself in the Silicon Valley tech culture and working alongside incredibly talented engineers.

## Embracing the Conference Circuit

2024 marked my return to active conference participation, both as a speaker and organizer. I had the privilege of sharing knowledge through two talks:

- [Componentizing Application State](/speaking/componentizing-application-state) at THAT Conference in Austin, exploring patterns for managing complex application state
- [Unleashing the TypeScript Compiler](/speaking/unleashing-the-typescript-compiler) at both KCDC and THAT Conference Wisconsin Dells, diving deep into TypeScript's capabilities

A personal highlight was emceeing the inaugural [Squiggle Conf](/posts/emceeing-squiggle-conf) in Boston. I also had the unique opportunity to organize an internal UI conference at Meta and interview inspiring speakers at [React Summit](/posts/react-summit-2024) in New York.

## Growing the Nebraska Tech Community

NebraskaJS has found its post-pandemic rhythm, and I'm proud of how we've adapted. We've maintained consistent meetups, attracted engaging speakers, and are expanding back to Lincoln in 2025. The launch of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JJaFMgscWf) and our new [Astro-powered website](https://github.com/NebraskaJS/nebraskajs.com/tree/nebraskajs-modern) represent our commitment to building a modern, accessible community. You can now also find us on Bluesky at [@nebraskajs.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/nebraskajs.dev).

## Finding a New Social Home

Speaking of Bluesky, it's become my primary social platform in 2024. The community there feels more aligned with my interests, and I've even integrated Bluesky comments and likes into this blog. While Twitter's future remains uncertain, I've found a new space for meaningful tech discussions.

## A Year in Motion

2024 kept me moving, with trips spanning work, conferences, and family time:
- Multiple extended stays in Menlo Park
- Conference speaking in Austin, Kansas City, and Wisconsin Dells
- Meta office visits in London and New York
- Family time in Branson, MO and Minneapolis
- Tech community events in Boston and New York

## New Horizons

As 2024 draws to a close, I'm thrilled to begin a new chapter as a Developer Experience Engineer at [WorkOS](https://workos.com). The role promises to combine my passion for developer tooling with the opportunity to work with a talented team that impressed me from day one.

Looking ahead to 2025, I'm excited to build on these experiences and continue growing both professionally and personally. The tech landscape is ever-changing, and I'm ready for the next adventure.
