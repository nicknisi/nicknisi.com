  From imposter syndrome to shipping features used by millions, here's what I learned during my year as a remote engineer at Meta.

Before joining Meta, I was comfortable. I had carved out my niche in developer experience at a financial services
company, making life better for front-end engineers through build systems, tooling, and design systems. Then came the
opportunity that would push me way outside that comfort zone: a role at Meta.

## Taking the Leap

I won't lie â€“ joining Meta was intimidating. This isn't just any tech company; it's one of the places where the tools
and frameworks we use every day were born. The company that turned React from an internal experiment into the library
that transformed how we build for the web. A place where some of the industry's brightest minds solve problems at a
scale that most of us can barely imagine.

As a father of two in the Midwest, far from the Silicon Valley bustle, I couldn't help but wonder: Could I keep up?
Would I belong? Looking at my interviewers' backgrounds during the hiring process â€“ MIT, Stanford, previous FAANG
experience â€“ it was hard not to feel like an outsider. The imposter syndrome was real.

But beneath the apprehension was genuine excitement. The team I'd be joining is working on Ads Manager â€“ literally the
oldest and largest React application in the world. The same codebase where React itself was born. The opportunity to
work on something with that kind of historical significance doesn't come along often. I knew I'd regret not taking the
chance to be part of that story.

## The Meta Way

Let's talk about Meta's dev tools. Unsurprisingly, I had opinions going in. [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) (okay,
[Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com) now) Instead of Git? A custom fork  of
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) when I had my [Neovim setup](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles) just
the way I liked it?  Their own programming languages like [Flow](https://flow.org) and [Hack](https://hacklang.org)
instead of my beloved [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)? My initial reaction was basically "why?"It seemed like
swimming upstream from the rest of the industry.

<Callout title="Neovim totally exists at Meta, btw.">
  I could totally use Neovim at meta. They have their own plugin to set it up and it's pretty nice. I just didn't
  want to deal with the inevitable issues that would arise in the beginning while I'm also ramping up on everything
  else, so I used Neovim through VSCode.

But are they wrong? What I discovered was an incredibly cohesive development environment where tools didn't just coexist
â€“ they worked in harmony. The way tasks, diffs, and chat seamlessly reference each other, how custom tools and even
custom Chrome extensions are used to tie everything together, and how the entire company can work in a single repository
â€“ it's impressive.

It's also clear how Flow and Hack were born out of the company's needs, and it's obvious how they influence each other.
They're not creating Flow as an alternative to TypeScript. They're making a language that feels familiar to Hack
developers, and vice versa.

## The Reality of Scale

Working on the Ads Manager brought another revelation. I expected the codebase to be immaculate â€“ pristine code with no
tech debt, bad patterns, or confusion. Instead, I found something very human: code that reflected the reality of
maintaining a massive application over many years. Yes, there was tech debt. Yes, there were outdated patterns. But
that wasn't a weakness; it was a validation that software engineering is hard at every scale, even at Meta. It was also
eye-opening seeing this code being incredibly performant and reliable.

On my team, we would regularly dive deep into both Hack APIs and React interfaces. We built in-app advertising
features and streamlined complex workflows, always trying to make the platform more accessible to newcomers while
maintaining its power for experienced advertisers of all sizes.

<Callout title="A Meta Moment">
One of my favorite memories? Getting texts from friends asking why my face kept showing up in their Instagram feeds.
  Look, when you're testing ad features, you gotta use what you've got. I like to think I brought a certain... charm to
  people's social media experience.

And what was I selling in this ad? Nothing! It was just a test video where I was singing "Never Gonna Give You Up",
acapella-style! ðŸ˜‚

## Finding Connection

Despite being remote, I found ways to connect. Our team operated like a well-oiled machine, everyone busy but never too
busy to help explain a project flow or deployment process. During our onsites, I made the most of every moment â€“
including a memorable karaoke party where I was the sole performer, belting out "Unbreak My Heart" to my amused
colleagues.

I even took on the role of _Social Captain_ for an internal, Meta-wide UIE Summit, helping create the conference's intro
video and bringing people together. These moments of connection made the virtual distance feel smaller.

## The Balancing Act

In the span of a month I emceed a conference on one coast, organized and ran an internal conference on the other coast,
and shipped two big features before a code freeze deadline! I worked more than 100 hours in a single week before it was
all over. Wild. But here's the thing - I did it. While being a dad. While running a podcast. While being a technical
advisor to two startups. While organizing meetups. While speaking at conferences. (Writing this out now, I'm questioning
how I had time for anything... ðŸ˜…)

## Time for Change

The decision to leave wasn't easy. Meta challenged me, taught me, and showed me what engineering at massive scale looks
like. But as time went on, I found myself craving something different. While my teammates were exceptional, I realized I
was spending more time on team alignment and metrics than actual engineering. The technical problems that energized me
were taking a backseat to the organizational mechanics of working at scale. In some ways, that's probably inevitable on
a product team of that size. But it wasn't where I wanted to focus my energy.

I considered looking for an internal transfer, perhaps to an internal infra team where I could focus more on the
technical challenges I'm passionate about. But with the current perceived emphasis on RTO, finding a team that was
amenable to remote teammates proved challenging. As a Midwest dad with roots in my community, relocating wasn't an
option I wanted to pursue.

An opportunity emerged that would let me return to my developer experience roots â€“ the kind of work that has always
energized me â€“ while building on everything I learned at Meta. It felt like the right time to take what I'd gained here
â€“ the confidence, the experience with scale, the understanding of complex organizations â€“ and apply it in a role more
aligned with my technical passions.

## Looking Back

You know what's funny about big tech companies? From the outside, they can seem almost mythical. I remember thinking
Meta engineers must be coding wizards who never ship bugs and write perfect PRs in their sleep. But after a year there,
I've learned something important: we're all just people trying to build good stuff while juggling meetings and fixing
prod issues.

Yeah, I worked at Meta. No, I didn't become some 10x engineer or discover the secret sauce to perfect code. What I did
do was show up every day, ship some cool features, work with some incredibly smart people, and learn a ton about
building software at ridiculous scale.

I'm grateful for the experience, but I'm also excited about what's next. Meta taught me a lot about what I want (and
don't want) in my engineering career. Most importantly? It taught me that there's no magic - just people solving
problems together, whether that's at a FAANG company or a two-person startup.

Time to take these lessons and build something new.
