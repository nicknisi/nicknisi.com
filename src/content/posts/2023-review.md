Better late than never, right? 2023 was a big year in a lot of ways and has really geared me up for a fresh and
exciting 2024! Here's what happened, what I accomplished, and what I'm looking forward to going into 2024.

## Accomplishments

- Celebrated 10 years of marriage. We got married on our 5th anniversary of dating, so we also celebrated 15
  years together. We celebrated with a trip to Vegas
- I visited the [C2FO](https://c2fo.com) offices in India. It was an amazing trip which included a trip to the Taj Mahal and attending my first cricket match!
- I attended the [Problem-Solving Leadership](https://www.congruentchange.com/problem-solving-leadership/) workshop in Albuquerque, NM taught by [Esther Derby](https://estherderby.com) and [Don Gray](https://www.donaldegray.com). This was life-changing and I highly recommend it to everyone.
- I spoke at [KCDC](https://www.kcdc.info) on XState. I can't recommend this conference enough!
- Celebrated 5 years of being on the [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) podcast. Here's to many more!
- I took my family to DisneyWorld. The kids absoutely loved it (and so did I).

## What's coming in 2024?

I'm starting the year off big by leaving my current job for a new opportunity (more soon) and I'm speaking at [THAT Conference](https://feature.thatconference.com/members/nicknisi) in Austin at the end of January. I'm also looking forward to more adventures with the family and growing a side-project, [Dev Dilemmas](https://dilemmas.dev), with [John Christopher](https://jdotc.xyz) where we're focused on content, courses, and consulting.
