# Projects

> For a complete, up-to-date list of projects I'm working on, please follow me on [Github](https://github.com/nicknisi)!

## [Thumbs](https://github.com/C2FO/thumbs)

Thumbs is an "evolution" on top of Backbone, bringing some of the best parts of Dojo over to the Backbone/jQuery world.

## [Dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles)

I am a big command line and vim user. My dotfiles set up the world I live in every day.

## [grunt-bower-config](https://github.com/nicknisi/grunt-bower-config)

This task adds an extra step in the bower installation process, allowing us to download all dependency files (which often include the
dependency's entire git repo) into a temporary location and then copy only the files we need (specified in the component.json/bower.json) into
our project's vendor directory.

## [Wedding Game](wedding-game/)

An incomplete game featuring myself, my wife, and Neil Diamond. It originally
appeared on our wedding web site, but, like many things, I never got around to
fully finishing it. Enjoy!
