# Uses

## Development Environment

I work almost exclusively in the terminal, from editing to git commands. For the most up-to-date setup, check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles).

### Editor

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) (I alias `nvim` to `vim` because muscle memory ðŸ¦¾)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator
- [Base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) color scheme
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) font

#### Neovim as an IDE

Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles) repo for the most up-to-date configuration as this can change quite often. I'll list some staples of my setup here.

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is a simple plugin manager that manages the 50+ vim plugins I have installed
- [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is a wonderful way to work with Git from within GitHub.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) makes fuzzy finding anything in vim super easy
- [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) is the conqueror of completion. This is the main interface with language servers, such as tsserver.

##### coc.nvim plugins

coc.nvim provides its own plugin system. Here are some of the important plugins I use.

- [coc-tsserver](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-tsserver) provides access to TS/JS warnings and errors
- [coc-git](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-git) visually indicates changes lines and complements Fugitive for working with Git inside of vim
- [coc-prettier](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-prettier) makes my code look good and compliant on save
- [coc-ultisnips](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coc-ultisnips) Lets me define my own snippets which can be completed and run within vim, saving me time
- [coc-explorer](https://github.com/weirongxu/coc-explorer) is a powerful file explorer, similar to NERDTree


### Terminal

- [LazyDocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) because I don't know what I'm doing with Docker
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a fast alternative to grep/ack/ag
- [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) official GitHub CLI

## Browser extensions
